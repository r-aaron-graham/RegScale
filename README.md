# RegScale CCM â€“ RAG-Optimized Compliance Automation Platform

**Continuous Controls Monitoring powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation, LangChain, Pinecone, and Elasticsearch**

---

## Overview

RegScale CCM (Continuous Controls Monitoring) is an intelligent compliance automation system designed to radically accelerate audit readiness, evidence gathering, and continuous compliance for regulated enterprises.

**Powered by a hybrid RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture**, this solution leverages the best of vector search (Pinecone), keyword retrieval (Elasticsearch), and LLM orchestration (LangChain + GPT-4/3.5) to ground responses in real-time, organization-specific controls evidence.

> **Mission:** Deliver on-demand, audit-ready answers with transparent sourcing, proactive gap detection, and instant remediation actions â€“ fully aligned with RegScaleâ€™s compliance-first ethos and production standards.
